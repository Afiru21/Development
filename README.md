# Design documentation

## Introduction
*This is an intorduction to my project*

I have recently joined a web development company, Hot Beans Web as a junior web developer. I have been asked as part of your induction and training to create a new section for the company’s web site which promotes the company to prospective employees, as they need to recruit more web developers.


## Identification of user requirements 
*These are the user requirements for the project*

The company wants me to include the following things:

- A profile of the company itself
- Profiles of existing trainee web developers
- Job specifications and required qualifications
- An on-line application form
- Links to web development courses

The target audience for the site is people who have completed training courses or qualifications related to web development and are now looking for a job as a web developer.

### The client requirements:
<ins>Company profile</ins> - The website will have to clearly present an overview of the company in this case Hot Beans Web, in which it will be described  and defined the company’s mission,its values, and even what makes it a great workplace for web developers.

<ins>Profiles of existing trainee web developers</ins> : it s important to try to highlight the experience and even the  backgrounds of current trainee web developers in the website   in order to give potential applicants some  insight into the company’s culture and opportunities its  for growth.

<ins>Job specifications and equired qualifications</ins> : In the website I should consider writing a  detailed job descriptions for the  open web development positions available at the moment at the company, I should also include the required qualifications, skills, and responsibilities they will have on the job.

<ins>Online application form</ins> : I will have to include in the website an online form where the prospective applicants would be able to submit their applications directly through the website, which should be able to capture the  applicant personal details, qualifications, work experience, and a link to their portfolio.

<ins>Links to web development courses</ins> : I should also include a  list of recommended web development courses and resources in order  to guide the  prospective applicants into trying to  improve their skills and qualifications futhermore.

<ins>Target audience</ins> : The primary target audience for this website  are people who have recently completed a web development training or courses and are looking for job opportunities as web developers role. This type of audience is most  likely gonna be tech-savvy and wanting to grow further  their careers into web development.

### Plan to Meet Client Requirements :
**User Requirements Identification:**
- The website will have to attract and catch a specific user group’s attention, so its important for me to understand their needs. Based on the client requirements I have  identified the following needs in the website:
A clear and informative company profile: this is needed because users will have  to be able to  easily understand who Hot Beans Web is and why it’s a beneficial place to work at.
- An easy access to Job openings:  this is needed because users should be able to quickly find some relevant job listings and understand the qualifications needed for that job.
- A simple and intuitive application form: this is needed because the form should be easy for the user  to fill out, which will also ensure a smooth application process for the user.
- Resources for career development: links to  varius web development courses need to be easily accessible and helpful for the  users who want to improve their skills and qualifications.
- Mobile and browser compatibility: The website needs to be functional across all  vaius devices and browsers to be able to attract users on various platforms.
- A visually appealing design: The website design should be modern, clean, and professional, which would surely appeal all the potential candidates looking for a tech-savvy employer.



## Visual designs for web pages
**Wireframes**

I used draw.io to help me create this viusula design for the web pages.

**Justifications of the visual designs decisions**

**User flow diagrams**
*User Flow Diagrams – Explain how users will navigate through your website.*

**Color scheme and Typography choices**

The logo

![TheLogo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9561d80f-470c-49a4-ac51-01fee3825e06)

I utilised the logo to get an extract gradient from it

![ExtractGradient2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e07e7c99-baf2-4be7-b226-60843b9eaeaf)

### The color palette 

![ColorPalette](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7265a847-e52b-41cb-ad63-2fb32efe538e)

### Typography 
For the headings I am planning to use the font “Montserrat” in order to give the website a more modern, bold, clean look.
For the body text on the other way I am planning to utilise the font “Open Sans”  in order to make the website more easy to  read, as well as more professional as possible.

## Alternative design options
The alternative design option I come up for the website  is having a more minimalist design,which means  relying  mostly on large images and very short phrases and text. 

### Advantages :
The advantage of this alternative design option is that the website design would be more visually appealing, and will feel more modern compared to my original design.

### Disadvantages : 
The disadvantage of this alternative design option is that the website design will lack the detail needed for the prospective employees in order  to make  decisions based on the information provided which  could lead to the user/viewer needing to scroll down the website more which could potentially lead to a less clear navigation if icons are abstract.

### My original design :
The reason I  have chosen my original design over this alternative design option is because it would create a balance between the visual elements and the clear and concise text which will ensure that all the  required information is readily available without overwhelming the user, while still  providing a professional and informative experience for the viewer/user.
  
## Technical documentation
This section outlines the technologies, structure, and development considerations.
#### Technologies : 
- I will use HTML for a semantic structure of all web pages.
- I will use CSS  for styling, layout.
- I will use JavaScript for interactive elements form validation, navigation  and potentially dynamic content loading like when viewing job details.
- I will use GitHub for tracking changes and deployment.

#### Structure of the file

![Screenshot 2025-05-23 112614](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6637134-bba6-4362-860d-b17392d67fba)

#### Accessibility Considerations :
- I will use appropriate HTML5 tags like  header, nav, main , article , section, footer, form in my website code.
- I will make sure to use the alt attributes for all images.
- I will make sure that all the interactive elements like buttons, links, form fields are easily  navigable for the user.
- I will have to include visual interactive  elements which users  focus on.
- I will have to use some sort of validation check for when  user input in the required input fields.
- I will have to make sure there is sufficient color contrast between the text and background for  better readability for the user.
- I will have to assign proper labels with their corresponding form fields.

  

# Development justification 

## Justification of design decision made
*This is my justification of the design decisions I  made, explaining how it will meet the user needs and be fit for purpose.*

The design decisions I made for the website ,which are shown above in the design documentation, are rigorously planned in order to meet the client requirements and making sure that the website I will develop will be fit for its purpose  which is attracting prospective web developers to join  Hot Beans Web.

#### Visual Appeal and Professionalism : 
- The design has a clean and modern aesthetic thanks to my chosen color palette going from green, blue, grey ,black and white and fonts like Montserrat, Open Sans. The website will have a professional yet dynamic image, and will appeal to the tech-savvy audience. This aspect of my website is capable of addressing the need for a professional and trustworthy appearance, which is crucial for attracting top talent.
- The website  design has an effective use of imagery from the high-quality images of the office environment, team members, and logo which humanize the company and provide visual context, making the site more engaging and relatable for the users. This will surely  help showcasing the company more effectively to the audience.

#### Meeting the client requirements : 
- Trainee Profiles: Instead of just text, individual profiles with photos and personal quotes the Trainees  profiles directly address the user's desire for more relatable experiences and give some insight into this  career progression. This is a powerful tool for understanding career paths/opportunities.
- Detailed Job Descriptions: The job description page  for the opening jobs  is comprehensive and contains the  individual job specs in detail, making sure users get all the necessary information about the job roles, skills, and qualifications,which in my opinion is  directly meeting the need for detailed job information.
- User-friendly application form: The application form has clear headings and validation checks   which make it easy to use, reducing potential incorrect characters being imputed due to user frustration which also increase the completion rate of the form. Basically This directly streamlines the online application process.
-  Course Links: The links section for the web development courses helps going  beyond basic job recruitment by offering the audience some  valuable resources to improve their web development skills, this helps demonstrating the audience Hot Beans Web's  serious commitment to employee development and a understanding of the target audience's journey, this in my opinion is able to meet the need for resources for skill enhancement.

#### User Experience:
- Responsiveness : The use of flexible layouts directly ensures responsiveness across different devices.  Given the diverse devices users will utilise it will guarantee a consistent and positive experience regardless of screen size across devices such as mobile phone,tablet and laptop and desktop.
- Accessibility: my wish to be able to integrate  accessibility best practices from the design phase (semantic HTML, alt text, keyboard navigation) would have ensured the website could have been accessible by a larger audience, which would have reflected a professional and inclusive approach.

#### Conclusion
In summary, the website  design choice I made prioritises clarity, professional appeal, and ease of use, directly aligning with the needs of the target audience. By providing a comprehensive and intuitive experience, the website aims to effectively promote Hot Beans Web as an attractive employer, ultimately achieving the client's goal of recruiting more web developers.

## Review
* This my personal review on the extent to which the website I created meets client requirements.*

Based on the scenario I was provided and the list of requirements for the features the website needed to have , my planning of the design  and the  development of the Hot Beans Web recruitment section showcase my clear understanding of the client's needs and aims to fully  meet them.
Here's a review of how the website I created  is able to meet each one of the client requirement:

#### A profile of the company:
I was able to meet the client requirement for creating a  profile of the company itself in which I included content covering Hot Beans Web's history, values, mission, and a general overview of its services.
This will  provide prospective employees with the essential information about who Hot Beans Web is, which in turn will help them to understand the company before trying to  apply for the job. This page  is really important for attracting candidates who align with the company's goals.

#### Profiles of Existing Trainee Web Developers:
I was able to meet the client requirement for creating profiles of the existing trainee web developers,I have created individual sections for each trainee, featuring their name, photo, and a brief description of their role, experience at Hot Beans, and their journey into web development. This element is crucial for the target audience since it offers them some relatable successful stories and a glimpse into their  day-to-day life and growth opportunities within the company, making the prospect of joining more appealing for the audience and furthermore it helps to foster trust.

#### Job Specifications and Required Qualifications :
I was able to meet the client requirement for creating job specifications and required qualifications for joining the company. The website  showcases detailed descriptions for the  available web developer roles, outlining their responsibilities, expected skills, technologies used, and academic/professional qualifications. This is an important requirement for any recruitment site since it makes sure that the  candidates understand what is expected of them and helps them understand if they have the required skills, which then helps Hot Beans to attract qualified applicants.

#### An On-line Application Form : 
I was able to meet the client requirement for creating An On-line Application Form, this is a crucial interactive component, since allows the audience to send their application forms directly from the website by entering input in the  fields for personal details, contact information, relevant experience, qualifications, and  file uploads for resumes/cover letters. This helps the audience by giving them a direct, efficient, and modern method for candidates to apply, eliminating manual processes and making it convenient for the target audience (who are most likely tech-savvy and prefer online interaction). 

#### Links to Web Development Courses : 
I was able to meet the client requirement for creating a section for the links to web development courses , offering this way some resources for learning web development.This demonstrates Hot Beans Web commitment to fostering talent and learning, which can attract the target audience (individuals who have completed training or qualifications). It shows that Hot Beans Web supports  the audience  growth in web development , even for those who might need to refresh up on their  skills or learn new ones before or during their employment. It also poetry the company as a helpful resource in the web development community.

#### Conclusion 
The website I created still meets its intended purpose which is to help Hot Beans Web recruit web developers to join the company and it also meets the client's requirements. The website design clearly  shows the necessary content and interactive elements. Furthermore, considering the target audience (web development job seekers), the  trainee profiles and course links make the website functional and  creates an engaging and supportive environment that positively welcomes prospective employees.



## Feedbacks 
*This is a feedback on the design documentationn for the website I will create.*

#### Identified areas of improvement
Based on this feedback I recived on my design documetation for the website I identified several areas which could be iprved in order to enchance my website's desifn document. Firstf of alls my design document is well-structured and comprehensive however I could enhance it furthermore by using  consistent heading styles like H1 for main sections, H2 for subsections,using  bullet points for easier readability,making sure  that images and  screenshots are high-quality and annotated to highlight key features, and trying to avoid being repetitive to keep it more engaging.

# Evidence of individual responsability effective time management including a time plan and witness testimony from your tutor
*Thiese are some evidence that showcase my individual responsability and time nmanagement.*

As a junior web developer at Hot Beans Web, taking on the task of building the recruitment section requires a proactive approach. Here's how I have demonstrate these key qualities:

#### Design Phase "analysing requirements" :

Responsibility: Before jumping straight  into code, I have carefully analysed and reviewed the client requirements which were developing  : company profile, trainee profiles, job specs/qualifications, online application form, and links to courses. Instead of going first into the coding part I took my time  reading,analysing and inferring on these requirements and thi in my opinion  has demonstrated my  responsibility in  seeking clarity on the project requirements instead of risking missing them by going straight to coding without thinking of the requirements. 

#### Design Phase "wireframes" :
Self-Management & Creativity: Even as a junior, I have used free tools (like draw io to create the wireframe for the website.  This helped me visualize the layout and flow before starting the  coding. This  shows self-management by planning visually and creativity in exploring different layouts. Additionally I shared my design documentation to get early feedback on how to improve it.

#### Review Phase "self testing" :
Self-Management: Before even thinking about asking for a peer review, I would conduct my own rigorous testing which includes: 
- Functional Testing: Clicking every link, submitting the form with valid and invalid data, verifying all content displays.
- Compatibility Testing: Checking the site on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari if possible) and on various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) using developer tools or actual devices.
- Usability Check: Navigating through the site as if I were a prospective applicant. Is anything confusing? Is the information easy to find?
- Accessibility Check : Ensuring images have tags, form fields have labels, and basic navigation works.

#### Review Phase "Geeting a Feedback" : 
- Responsibility: Once I was  satisfied with my self-review, I requested feedback from my peers. I shared my design documentation and got suggestions on how to improve my work. 
- Effective Self-Management: I'd approach feedback constructively. Instead of defending my choices, I'd listen carefully, ask clarifying questions, and prioritize the feedback based on impact and effort. I'd then create a plan to address the feedback points, demonstrating my ability to iterate and improve.

#### Conclusion
By consistently demonstrating my individual responsibility, creativity, and effective self-management throughout this project which is designing and developing a website based on the client requirements, I would be able to successfully complete the task and also demonstrate my skills  as a capable junior web developer at Hot Beans Web.
