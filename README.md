# Design documentation

## Introduction
*This is an intorduction to my project*

I have recently joined a web development company, Hot Beans Web as a junior web developer. I have been asked as part of your induction and training to create a new section for the company’s web site which promotes the company to prospective employees, as they need to recruit more web developers.


## Identification of user requirements 
*These are the user requirements for the project*

The company wants me to include the following things:

- A profile of the company itself
- Profiles of existing trainee web developers
- Job specifications and required qualifications
- An on-line application form
- Links to web development courses

The target audience for the site is people who have completed training courses or qualifications related to web development and are now looking for a job as a web developer.

### The client requirements:
<ins>Company profile</ins> - The website will have to clearly present an overview of the company in this case Hot Beans Web, in which it will be described  and defined the company’s mission,its values, and even what makes it a great workplace for web developers.

<ins>Profiles of existing trainee web developers</ins> : it s important to try to highlight the experience and even the  backgrounds of current trainee web developers in the website   in order to give potential applicants some  insight into the company’s culture and opportunities its  for growth.

<ins>Job specifications and equired qualifications</ins> : In the website I should consider writing a  detailed job descriptions for the  open web development positions available at the moment at the company, I should also include the required qualifications, skills, and responsibilities they will have on the job.

<ins>Online application form</ins> : I will have to include in the website an online form where the prospective applicants would be able to submit their applications directly through the website, which should be able to capture the  applicant personal details, qualifications, work experience, and a link to their portfolio.

<ins>Links to web development courses</ins> : I should also include a  list of recommended web development courses and resources in order  to guide the  prospective applicants into trying to  improve their skills and qualifications futhermore.

<ins>Target audience</ins> : The primary target audience for this website  are people who have recently completed a web development training or courses and are looking for job opportunities as web developers role. This type of audience is most  likely gonna be tech-savvy and wanting to grow further  their careers into web development.

### Plan to Meet Client Requirements :
**User Requirements Identification:**
- The website will have to attract and catch a specific user group’s attention, so its important for me to understand their needs. Based on the client requirements I have  identified the following needs in the website:
A clear and informative company profile: this is needed because users will have  to be able to  easily understand who Hot Beans Web is and why it’s a beneficial place to work at.
- An easy access to Job openings:  this is needed because users should be able to quickly find some relevant job listings and understand the qualifications needed for that job.
- A simple and intuitive application form: this is needed because the form should be easy for the user  to fill out, which will also ensure a smooth application process for the user.
- Resources for career development: links to  varius web development courses need to be easily accessible and helpful for the  users who want to improve their skills and qualifications.
- Mobile and browser compatibility: The website needs to be functional across all  vaius devices and browsers to be able to attract users on various platforms.
- A visually appealing design: The website design should be modern, clean, and professional, which would surely appeal all the potential candidates looking for a tech-savvy employer.



## Visual designs for web pages
**Wireframes**

I used draw.io to help me create this viusula design for the web pages.

**Justifications of the visual designs decisions**

**User flow diagrams**
*User Flow Diagrams – Explain how users will navigate through your website.*

**Color scheme and Typography choices**

The logo

I utilised the logo to get an extract gradient from it

### The color palette

### Typography 
For the headings I am planning to use the font “Montserrat” in order to give the website a more modern, bold, clean look.
For the body text on the other way I am planning to utilise the font “Open Sans”  in order to make the website more easy to  read, as well as more professional as possible.




## Alternative design options
The alternative design option I come up for the website  is having a more minimalist design,which means  relying  mostly on large images and very short phrases and text. 

### Advantages :
The advantage of this alternative design option is that the website design would be more visually appealing, and will feel more modern compared to my original design.

### Disadvantages : 
The disadvantage of this alternative design option is that the website design will lack the detail needed for the prospective employees in order  to make  decisions based on the information provided which  could lead to the user/viewer needing to scroll down the website more which could potentially lead to a less clear navigation if icons are abstract.

### My original design :
The reason I  have chosen my original design over this alternative design option is because it would create a balance between the visual elements and the clear and concise text which will ensure that all the  required information is readily available without overwhelming the user, while still  providing a professional and informative experience for the viewer/user.
