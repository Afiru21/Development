# Design documentation

## Introduction
*This is an intorduction to my project*

I have recently joined a web development company, Hot Beans Web as a junior web developer. I have been asked as part of your induction and training to create a new section for the company’s web site which promotes the company to prospective employees, as they need to recruit more web developers.


## Identification of user requirements 
*These are the user requirements for the project*

The company wants me to include the following things:

- A profile of the company itself
- Profiles of existing trainee web developers
- Job specifications and required qualifications
- An on-line application form
- Links to web development courses

The target audience for the site is people who have completed training courses or qualifications related to web development and are now looking for a job as a web developer.

### The client requirements:
<ins>Company profile</ins> - The website will have to clearly present an overview of the company in this case Hot Beans Web, in which it will be described  and defined the company’s mission,its values, and even what makes it a great workplace for web developers.

<ins>Profiles of existing trainee web developers</ins> : it s important to try to highlight the experience and even the  backgrounds of current trainee web developers in the website   in order to give potential applicants some  insight into the company’s culture and opportunities its  for growth.

<ins>Job specifications and equired qualifications</ins> : In the website I should consider writing a  detailed job descriptions for the  open web development positions available at the moment at the company, I should also include the required qualifications, skills, and responsibilities they will have on the job.

<ins>Online application form</ins> : I will have to include in the website an online form where the prospective applicants would be able to submit their applications directly through the website, which should be able to capture the  applicant personal details, qualifications, work experience, and a link to their portfolio.

<ins>Links to web development courses</ins> : I should also include a  list of recommended web development courses and resources in order  to guide the  prospective applicants into trying to  improve their skills and qualifications futhermore.

<ins>Target audience</ins> : The primary target audience for this website  are people who have recently completed a web development training or courses and are looking for job opportunities as web developers role. This type of audience is most  likely gonna be tech-savvy and wanting to grow further  their careers into web development.

### Plan to Meet Client Requirements :
**User Requirements Identification:**
- The website will have to attract and catch a specific user group’s attention, so its important for me to understand their needs. Based on the client requirements I have  identified the following needs in the website:
A clear and informative company profile: this is needed because users will have  to be able to  easily understand who Hot Beans Web is and why it’s a beneficial place to work at.
- An easy access to Job openings:  this is needed because users should be able to quickly find some relevant job listings and understand the qualifications needed for that job.
- A simple and intuitive application form: this is needed because the form should be easy for the user  to fill out, which will also ensure a smooth application process for the user.
- Resources for career development: links to  varius web development courses need to be easily accessible and helpful for the  users who want to improve their skills and qualifications.
- Mobile and browser compatibility: The website needs to be functional across all  vaius devices and browsers to be able to attract users on various platforms.
- A visually appealing design: The website design should be modern, clean, and professional, which would surely appeal all the potential candidates looking for a tech-savvy employer.

I used Figma  to help me create these visual mockup designs for the website  pages.

**Color scheme and Typography choices**

The logo

![TheLogo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9561d80f-470c-49a4-ac51-01fee3825e06)

I utilised the logo to get an extract gradient from it

### The color palette 

![ColorPalette](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7265a847-e52b-41cb-ad63-2fb32efe538e)

### Typography 
For the headings I am planning to use the font “Montserrat” in order to give the website a more modern, bold, clean look.
For the body text on the other way I am planning to utilise the font “Open Sans”  in order to make the website more easy to  read, as well as more professional as possible.

## Alternative design options
The alternative design option I come up for the website  is having a more minimalist design,which means  relying  mostly on large images and very short phrases and text. 

I used Figma  to help me create these alternative visual mockup designs for the website  pages.

### Advantages :
The advantage of this alternative design option is that the website design would be more visually appealing, and will feel more modern compared to my original design.

### Disadvantages : 
The disadvantage of this alternative design option is that the website design will lack the detail needed for the prospective employees in order  to make  decisions based on the information provided which  could lead to the user/viewer needing to scroll down the website more which could potentially lead to a less clear navigation if icons are abstract.

### My original design :
The reason I  have chosen my original design over this alternative design option is because it would create a balance between the visual elements and the clear and concise text which will ensure that all the  required information is readily available without overwhelming the user, while still  providing a professional and informative experience for the viewer/user.
  
## Technical documentation
This section outlines the technologies, structure, and development considerations.
#### Technologies : 
- I will use HTML for a semantic structure of all web pages.
- I will use CSS  for styling, layout.
- I will use JavaScript for interactive elements form validation, navigation  and potentially dynamic content loading like when viewing job details.
- I will use GitHub for tracking changes and deployment.

#### Structure of the file

![Screenshot 2025-05-23 112614](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6637134-bba6-4362-860d-b17392d67fba)

#### Accessibility Considerations :
- I will use appropriate HTML5 tags like  header, nav, main , article , section, footer, form in my website code.
- I will make sure to use the alt attributes for all images.
- I will make sure that all the interactive elements like buttons, links, form fields are easily  navigable for the user.
- I will have to include visual interactive  elements which users  focus on.
- I will have to use some sort of validation check for when  user input in the required input fields.
- I will have to make sure there is sufficient color contrast between the text and background for  better readability for the user.
- I will have to assign proper labels with their corresponding form fields.

  

# Development justification 

## Justification of design decision made
*This is my justification of the design decisions I  made, explaining how it will meet the user needs and be fit for purpose.*

The design decisions I made for the website ,which are shown above in the design documentation, are rigorously planned in order to meet the client requirements and making sure that the website I will develop will be fit for its purpose  which is attracting prospective web developers to join  Hot Beans Web.

#### Visual Appeal and Professionalism : 
- The design has a clean and modern aesthetic thanks to my chosen color palette going from green, blue, grey ,black and white and fonts like Montserrat, Open Sans. The website will have a professional yet dynamic image, and will appeal to the tech-savvy audience. This aspect of my website is capable of addressing the need for a professional and trustworthy appearance, which is crucial for attracting top talent.
- The website  design has an effective use of imagery from the high-quality images of the office environment, team members, and logo which humanize the company and provide visual context, making the site more engaging and relatable for the users. This will surely  help showcasing the company more effectively to the audience.

#### Meeting the client requirements : 
- Trainee Profiles: Instead of just text, individual profiles with photos and personal quotes the Trainees  profiles directly address the user's desire for more relatable experiences and give some insight into this  career progression. This is a powerful tool for understanding career paths/opportunities.
- Detailed Job Descriptions: The job description page  for the opening jobs  is comprehensive and contains the  individual job specs in detail, making sure users get all the necessary information about the job roles, skills, and qualifications,which in my opinion is  directly meeting the need for detailed job information.
- User-friendly application form: The application form has clear headings and validation checks   which make it easy to use, reducing potential incorrect characters being imputed due to user frustration which also increase the completion rate of the form. Basically This directly streamlines the online application process.
-  Course Links: The links section for the web development courses helps going  beyond basic job recruitment by offering the audience some  valuable resources to improve their web development skills, this helps demonstrating the audience Hot Beans Web's  serious commitment to employee development and a understanding of the target audience's journey, this in my opinion is able to meet the need for resources for skill enhancement.

#### User Experience:
- Responsiveness : The use of flexible layouts directly ensures responsiveness across different devices.  Given the diverse devices users will utilise it will guarantee a consistent and positive experience regardless of screen size across devices such as mobile phone,tablet and laptop and desktop.
- Accessibility: my wish to be able to integrate  accessibility best practices from the design phase (semantic HTML, alt text, keyboard navigation) would have ensured the website could have been accessible by a larger audience, which would have reflected a professional and inclusive approach.

#### Conclusion
In summary, the website  design choice I made prioritises clarity, professional appeal, and ease of use, directly aligning with the needs of the target audience. By providing a comprehensive and intuitive experience, the website aims to effectively promote Hot Beans Web as an attractive employer, ultimately achieving the client's goal of recruiting more web developers.

## Review
* This my personal review on the extent to which the website I created meets client requirements.*

Based on the scenario I was provided and the list of requirements for the features the website needed to have , my planning of the design  and the  development of the Hot Beans Web recruitment section showcase my clear understanding of the client's needs and aims to fully  meet them.
Here's a review of how the website I created  is able to meet each one of the client requirement:

#### A profile of the company:
I was able to meet the client requirement for creating a  profile of the company itself in which I included content covering Hot Beans Web's history, values, mission, and a general overview of its services.
This will  provide prospective employees with the essential information about who Hot Beans Web is, which in turn will help them to understand the company before trying to  apply for the job. This page  is really important for attracting candidates who align with the company's goals.

#### Profiles of Existing Trainee Web Developers:
I was able to meet the client requirement for creating profiles of the existing trainee web developers,I have created individual sections for each trainee, featuring their name, photo, and a brief description of their role, experience at Hot Beans, and their journey into web development. This element is crucial for the target audience since it offers them some relatable successful stories and a glimpse into their  day-to-day life and growth opportunities within the company, making the prospect of joining more appealing for the audience and furthermore it helps to foster trust.

#### Job Specifications and Required Qualifications :
I was able to meet the client requirement for creating job specifications and required qualifications for joining the company. The website  showcases detailed descriptions for the  available web developer roles, outlining their responsibilities, expected skills, technologies used, and academic/professional qualifications. This is an important requirement for any recruitment site since it makes sure that the  candidates understand what is expected of them and helps them understand if they have the required skills, which then helps Hot Beans to attract qualified applicants.

#### An On-line Application Form : 
I was able to meet the client requirement for creating An On-line Application Form, this is a crucial interactive component, since allows the audience to send their application forms directly from the website by entering input in the  fields for personal details, contact information, relevant experience, qualifications, and  file uploads for resumes/cover letters. This helps the audience by giving them a direct, efficient, and modern method for candidates to apply, eliminating manual processes and making it convenient for the target audience (who are most likely tech-savvy and prefer online interaction). 

#### Links to Web Development Courses : 
I was able to meet the client requirement for creating a section for the links to web development courses , offering this way some resources for learning web development.This demonstrates Hot Beans Web commitment to fostering talent and learning, which can attract the target audience (individuals who have completed training or qualifications). It shows that Hot Beans Web supports  the audience  growth in web development , even for those who might need to refresh up on their  skills or learn new ones before or during their employment. It also poetry the company as a helpful resource in the web development community.

#### Conclusion 
The website I created still meets its intended purpose which is to help Hot Beans Web recruit web developers to join the company and it also meets the client's requirements. The website design clearly  shows the necessary content and interactive elements. Furthermore, considering the target audience (web development job seekers), the  trainee profiles and course links make the website functional and  creates an engaging and supportive environment that positively welcomes prospective employees.

#### Identified areas of improvement
Based on this feedback I recived on my design documetation for the website I identified several areas which could be iprved in order to enchance my website's desifn document. Firstf of alls my design document is well-structured and comprehensive however I could enhance it furthermore by using  consistent heading styles like H1 for main sections, H2 for subsections,using  bullet points for easier readability,making sure  that images and  screenshots are high-quality and annotated to highlight key features, and trying to avoid being repetitive to keep it more engaging.

# Evaluation of the design and development of the website
*This is an evaluation of the design and development of the website.*

## How I met the client's requirements 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07920b19-5a11-454e-a22b-e3b2c004907c)

The design I created  in my opinion is able to successfully includes all required features stated by the client and it perfectly aligns closely with their recruitment-focused goals

## Suitability for the target audience

Having to see that the target audience for this website were individuals who recently completed training in web development and are seeking junior roles.I had to create this website which in my opinion is suitable for this target audience,furthermore the website is clear, functional, and informative.

This website is suitable for the target audience because : 
- The visual design is modern and professional, which is appealing to tech-savvy users.
- The navigation is clear, with logical page structure and accessible content.
- The layout is mobile-responsive, which addresses the needs of users who may have to  access the website via phone or tablet.
- The inclusion of the  developer profiles and training resources such as links to websites for them to improve their skills  directly captivate users who are looking for their first break or ongoing learning.

## Functionality and usability

The website clearly  functions correctly and is able to provide a smooth user experience. 

The reason for this is that : 

- All of the major features such as navigation, forms, and  job listings  work as expected.
- The buttons, links, and form inputs have been  tested and are perfectly functional.
- There is also HTML5 validation that helps prevent users from leaving an  incomplete application form. 
- There are accessibility features included such as some clear headings.
- The usability tests performed on the website have  confirmed that users could find key information easily as well as submitting the application  forms without confusion.

## Cross-Browser and device compatibility

This website is visually and functionally consistent across different  devices and browsers.

This website was tested successfully on:
- Browsers: Chrome, and Edge
- Devices: Windows laptop,  Android phone, and tablet


I can say that the website  layout adapts correctly using responsive CSS

## Optimisation and Improvements Made

The only thing I changed in my optimised version of the website is  the layout in order to make it more appealing but of course I made sure to let the colors remains the same.

### Optimisation I made for the home page  

#### Structure and accessibility 
Before the home page code had multiple nav and section tags without a consistent hierarchy. This means it lacked the  proper use of aria attributes and labels.
This is part of my optimization. In the code I tried to implement a clearer and more semantic HTML5 structure  with  header, main, section, footer tags.
Additionally I also have improved the  form accessibility with proper label, aria-, and required fields.
Furthermore I added the viewport meta tag for a better  responsiveness:

##### Navigation bar 
Before the home page  had a custom,but non-functional hamburger menu with no actual toggle behavior.
This is why in my optimization I added Bootstrap's responsive navbar with a  collapse functionality. Thanks to this improvement the navigation is now mobile-friendly and accessible.

#### Visual design and layout
Before  the home page had a basic layout using raw Bootstrap without much styling.
This means there were minimal icons  or visual appeal to the page.
This is why in my optimization I added Google Fonts (Montserrat, Open Sans) for modern typography. I also used Bootstrap Icons for a more visually appealing UI (bi bi-gear-fill, etc.). Then I added styled buttons with icons and padding.
I also created a consistent section spacing, text-center, text-white, and layout alignment for having an improved aesthetics.

#### Content Organization
Before   the home page had long blocks of text dumped into a single <p> tag in the About section.Basically it did not have a section separation or visual cues.
After the optimisation I made I broke up the long text into smaller and more manageable paragraphs. I added "hero", "services", and "about teaser" sections in order to have better readability and UX. Furthermore I added clear call-to-actions (CTAs) such as  "Join Our Team", "Learn More".

#### Form Optimization
Before the home page had a basic form without validation feedback. It had only name, email, and CV upload fields.
After the optimisation it becomes a full-featured form having : input validation, error feedback with invalid-feedback, additional fields like phone, position selection,privacy policy consent checkbox, user guidance text for file uploads.

####  Performance and best practices  
Before  the home page had no optimization for fonts or icons and I only used images and custom nav.
After  the optimization it became loaded with fonts from Google,I also used CDN-based Bootstrap Icons.

#### Footer Enhancement
Before the home page  no footer was included.
After the optimisation it has now a well-structured and styled footer, I also included copyright. And a link to the Privacy and Contact pages

### Optimisation I made for the about page  
These are the optimizations I made on the About page code:

Semantic HTML5 structure - I used meaningful HTML5 elements like header, main, section, and footer, to improve accessibility and SEO.

Bootstrap CDN and responsive design - I usedU Bootstrap 5.3 via CDN to ensure a fast-loading framework with responsive grid classes (container, row, col-lg-6, etc.) that adapt well across different devices.

Efficient font loading - I preconnected to Google fonts domains (fonts.googleapis.com and fonts.gstatic.com) to speed up font loading

Icon usage via CDN -  Bootstrap Icons are loaded via CDN, avoiding bundling extra icon files and reducing the page weight.

Optimized images - I used  .PNG images with appropriate alt attributes and Bootstrap classes like img-fluid to ensure the images scale properly and improve accessibility.

Clean and  organized navigation - The navbar is structured with proper ARIA attributes and a collapsible toggler for mobile usability.

Modals for team member profiles - I used Bootstrap modals to show detailed team info, enhancing UX without impacting page load significantly.

Minimal external dependencies - I only loaded essential CSS and JS files from CDNs and a single local stylesheet/script, trying to keep resource loading minimal.

Consistent use of utility classes-  You use Bootstrap spacing and text utility classes (py-5, mb-4, text-center, etc.) to avoid custom CSS bloat.

Accessibility enhancements - I used ARIA roles and attributes (e.g., aria-current, aria-label, modal roles) in order to improve accessibility for screen readers.

### Optimisation I made for the contact page  

What I optimized :

Modern, responsive bootstrap navbar - I used Bootstrap’s built-in responsive navbar with toggler button and collapse for mobile views. I added meaningful ARIA attributes for accessibility (aria-controls, aria-expanded, aria-label).
I included a logo image with proper alt text and size for branding.

Improved typography and fonts - I imported Google Fonts (Montserrat and Open Sans) for a more  modern and consistent look. I enhanced the overall typography with readable font choices.

Better visual hierarchy and layout - I added a hero section with centered heading, subtitle, and office image to engage visitors immediately. I used the Bootstrap grid system (container, row, col-lg-7, col-lg-5) for having a clean two-column layout on larger screens. I also had cards with shadows (shadow-lg) in order to create a professional feeling to the form and contact info.

Enhanced contact form -  I used Bootstrap form classes (form-control, form-label, mb-3) for uniform styling and spacing. I added more input fields (e.g., Subject) for the audience inquiries.
I included client-side validation feedback with Bootstrap’s validation classes (invalid-feedback) for user-friendly error messages. I made the submit button styled with Bootstrap button classes and an icon (bi bi-send-fill).

Detailed contact information section - I visually enhanced the contact details with Bootstrap Icons (address, email, phone). The contact details links use mailto: and tel: protocols for easy interaction.I added social media icons with Bootstrap Icons for wider engagement opportunities.

Embedded Google Map - I added an interactive Google Map iframe with Bootstrap’s responsive ratio utility in order  to maintain aspect ratio across devices. I included a note to clarify the map is for demo, showing good communication.

Consistent footer design - after the optimisation the footer is visually separated with a dark background, centered text, and links styled with subtle colors for readability. Additionally there are Privacy and contact links included for easy navigation.

Performance and accessibility - I added preconnect hints for Google Fonts to optimize the font loading speed.  I properly used semantic HTML elements such as (header, main, section, footer). I also made some accessibility improvements in form and navbar (labels, ARIA).

### Optimisation I made for the privacy page  

What I optimized :

Use of Bootstrap CDN -  I have loaded Bootstrap CSS and JS from a CDN in order to have faster loading and caching.

Preconnect for Google Fonts - I used <link rel="preconnect"> to optimize the font loading performance.

Semantic HTML structure - I clearly  used  header, main, section, footer and proper headings h1, h2, h3. This will  improve accessibility and SEO.

Responsive navigation - The Bootstrap navbar toggler with collapse for mobile-friendly navigation is implemented correctly.

Use of icons (Bootstrap Icons) - I used icons to visually enhance the website and improve user experience and readability.

Container and grid classes - I used  Bootstrap’s container and grid system for a responsive layout.

Alt attributes for images - I included descriptive alt tags for images (e.g., logo, privacy image) which is great for accessibility.

Consistent class naming - I used utility classes like mt-5, pt-4, border-bottom consistently for spacing and borders, which keeps styling clean and concise.

Separate CSS and JS files - I linked the page  to style.css and script.js for modularity.

Footer links -  Including privacy and contact links in the footer for a more easy navigation.


### Optimisation I made for the jobs page  

What I optimized :

Use CSS Utility Classes Efficiently - I used multiple mb-0 on list groups inside accordion bodies. 

Consistent Use of Icons - I used Bootstrap Icons (bi bi-check-lg, bi bi-dot, etc.) consistently to make sure the icons match the text meaning for better UX.

Semantic HTML for Lists - I used ul and li correctly to ensure lists have meaningful content and use classes only for styling.

Schedule Section - I have schedule info outside the accordion, which is great for visibility. 

Button and link consistency - I added a main call-to-action at the bottom to "Fill Out Our Online Application Form"

## Conclusion

The final optimised website for Hot Beans Web effectively meets all of the  client requirements and is able to  provide a professional, user-friendly experience tailored for junior web developers. Through multiple design iterations, user testing, and targeted optimisations, the website has become more functional, accessible, and visually engaging. In my opinion the client goals were fully met, and the project stands as a suitable and reliable recruitment tool for Hot Beans Web.



# Evidence of individual responsability effective time management including a time plan and witness testimony from your tutor
*Thiese are some evidence that showcase my individual responsability and time nmanagement.*

As a junior web developer at Hot Beans Web, taking on the task of building the recruitment section requires a proactive approach. Here's how I have demonstrate these key qualities:

#### Design Phase "analysing requirements" :

Responsibility: Before jumping straight  into code, I have carefully analysed and reviewed the client requirements which were developing  : company profile, trainee profiles, job specs/qualifications, online application form, and links to courses. Instead of going first into the coding part I took my time  reading,analysing and inferring on these requirements and thi in my opinion  has demonstrated my  responsibility in  seeking clarity on the project requirements instead of risking missing them by going straight to coding without thinking of the requirements. 

#### Design Phase "wireframes" :
Self-Management & Creativity: Even as a junior, I have used free tools (like draw io to create the wireframe for the website.  This helped me visualize the layout and flow before starting the  coding. This  shows self-management by planning visually and creativity in exploring different layouts. Additionally I shared my design documentation to get early feedback on how to improve it.

#### Review Phase "self testing" :
Self-Management: Before even thinking about asking for a peer review, I would conduct my own rigorous testing which includes: 
- Functional Testing: Clicking every link, submitting the form with valid and invalid data, verifying all content displays.
- Compatibility Testing: Checking the site on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari if possible) and on various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) using developer tools or actual devices.
- Usability Check: Navigating through the site as if I were a prospective applicant. Is anything confusing? Is the information easy to find?
- Accessibility Check : Ensuring images have tags, form fields have labels, and basic navigation works.

#### Review Phase "Geeting a Feedback" : 
- Responsibility: Once I was  satisfied with my self-review, I requested feedback from my peers. I shared my design documentation and got suggestions on how to improve my work. 
- Effective Self-Management: I'd approach feedback constructively. Instead of defending my choices, I'd listen carefully, ask clarifying questions, and prioritize the feedback based on impact and effort. I'd then create a plan to address the feedback points, demonstrating my ability to iterate and improve.

#### Conclusion
By consistently demonstrating my individual responsibility, creativity, and effective self-management throughout this project which is designing and developing a website based on the client requirements, I would be able to successfully complete the task and also demonstrate my skills  as a capable junior web developer at Hot Beans Web.
