# Introduction
*This is an intorduction to my project*

I have recently joined a web development company, Hot Beans Web as a junior web developer. I have been asked as part of your induction and training to create a new section for the companyâ€™s web site which promotes the company to prospective employees, as they need to recruit more web developers.


# Identification of user requirements 
*These are the user requirements for the project*

The company wants me to include the following things:

- A profile of the company itself
- Profiles of existing trainee web developers
- Job specifications and required qualifications
- An on-line application form
- Links to web development courses

The target audience for the site is people who have completed training courses or qualifications related to web development and are now looking for a job as a web developer.
